[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beardandcode/users.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/beardandcode/users)

A library to manage and manipulate users for use with a webapp.

## Dependencies

As [com.beardandcode/forms](https://github.com/beardandcode/forms) is still in early development
there aren't any artefacts published to clojars. So in order to fulfill this dependency, you will
need to check out this project and run `lein install` locally.

## Try

Find your way to the directory where you checked out this project and execute the following:

```
$ lein repl

user=> (go)  ;; starts the example webapp on a random port
...
...
... c.beardandcode.components.web-server - Started web server on http://127.0.0.1:8080

```

Open the url found in your logs in the browser, it will likely be different to the one above.
